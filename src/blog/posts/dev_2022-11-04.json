AVIF is one of the more efficient image formats out there, promising smaller file sizes with better quality. And some developers might be tempted to switch in general to AVIF to maximize performance."

Other factors like lazy loading, efficient caching, backend optimizations, reducing scripts, etc. can have a much bigger impact on overall performance. But let's focus here solely on images, even then it's not as simple as just switching to the newest format available."

Lossless is often a good choice for photographers or artists who want to show their work on the web. But for web performance, lossy compression is generally the better option. Depending on the final image quality the file size can be significantly reduced while there is no noticeable difference for the end user. Some formats even support both lossless and lossy compression. AVIF and WebP, for example, can be used in either way."
