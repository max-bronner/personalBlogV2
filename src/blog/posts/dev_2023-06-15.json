      "content": "For years, CSS Container Queries were one of the most requested features web developers were asking for. I had countless discussions with others about how they could solve the limitations of media queries. Now that they’re finally here, I’ve used them over the last couple months — with mixed feelings."

      "content": "If you’ve been in web development for a while, you know the occasional struggles of writing clean code for responsive components. Traditional media queries focus solely on the screen size, which means they work well for general layout adjustments at specific breakpoints. But if the design requires more variety for different screen sizes, it gets easily messy."

      "component": "components/text/text",
      "content": "Things like nested components, dynamic sidebars and menues, or content blocks appearing in different contexts often require complex calculations, overlapping breakpoints, and maintaining consistency and redundancy across the entire codebase. Some of this can be streamlined with preprocessors like Sass, but the underlying problem remains."
    },
    {
      "component": "components/text/text",
      "content": "Container Queries promised to change that. Instead of designing components based on the entire viewport, we can apply styles to them depending on their own dimensions. This approach allows for better scoping and reduces dependencies on the rest of the page structure."

      "content": "Web development has changed a lot in the last decade. We’ve moved from static, rigid layouts to fluid, flexible designs. I still remember when tables were commonly used for layouting, which got 'fixed' with the introduction of Flexbox and later Grid. Even designers adapted, favoring more consistent, scalable, and adaptable layouts."

      "component": "components/text/text",

    },
    {
      "component": "components/text/text",
      "content": "But that doesn’t mean container queries are useless. Their ability to scope styles to an element’s own size is still a massive improvement. It makes components more self-contained and easier to reuse across different parts of a website without worrying about external factors. The component just adapts automatically."
    },
    {
      "component": "components/text/text",
